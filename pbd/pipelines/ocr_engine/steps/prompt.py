    "EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:\n"
    "1. Mathematical content:\n"
    "   - Preserve all equations exactly as written, maintaining proper notation\n"
    "   - Use LaTeX formatting: \\frac{a}{b}, \\int_{a}^{b}, \\sum_{i=1}^{n}, \\sqrt{x}, x^{2}, H_{2}O\n"
    "   - Common physics notation: \\vec{F}, \\hat{n}, \\nabla, \\partial, \\Delta, \\omega, \\theta, \\phi\n"
    "   - Units: maintain proper spacing (5 m/s, not 5m/s) and formatting (kg⋅m/s²)\n"
    "   - Matrix/vector notation: use \\begin{bmatrix}...\\end{bmatrix} or \\begin{pmatrix}...\\end{pmatrix}\n\n"
    "2. Textual content:\n"
    "   - Maintain paragraph structure and indentation\n"
    "   - Preserve exact problem numbering (1.2, Problem 3, Exercise 4.5, etc.)\n"
    "   - Include ALL text: footnotes, margin notes, captions, annotations\n"
    "   - Preserve formatting: **bold**, *italics*, underlined text\n"
    "   - Keep definition boxes, highlighted concepts, and key terms\n\n"
    "3. Visual elements:\n"
    "   - Describe diagrams: [DIAGRAM: Force diagram showing mass m on inclined plane at angle θ]\n"
    "   - Include ALL labels, measurements, arrows, and annotations from figures\n"
    "   - Note coordinate systems (x-y axes, polar coordinates, etc.)\n"
    "   - Describe graphs with axis labels, scales, and data points\n"
    "   - Include circuit diagrams with component values and connections\n\n"
    "4. Problem extraction (CRITICAL):\n"
    "   - Extract complete problem statements with ALL given information\n"
    '   - Include problem numbers/labels exactly as shown (e.g., "Problem 2.3", "Exercise 4-7", "Q15")\n'
    "   - Include ALL numerical values, units, and given conditions\n"
    "   - Extract complete solution steps if provided:\n"
    "     * Given/Find/Solution format when present\n"
    "     * Step-by-step mathematical work\n"
    "     * Intermediate calculations and substitutions\n"
    "     * Final answers with proper units and significant figures\n"
    "   - Include answer keys, hints, or solution references\n"
    "   - Preserve worked example formatting and organization\n"
    "   - Note any accompanying diagrams or figures for each problem\n\n"
    "5. Page structure:\n"
    "   - Follow reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom for multi-column)\n"
    "   - Include headers, footers, page numbers, chapter/section titles\n"
    "   - Preserve hierarchical structure (# ## ### for headings)\n"
    "   - Note any special formatting (boxes, sidebars, examples)\n\n"
    "CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n"
    "- Extract EVERYTHING visible - no content should be omitted\n"
    "- For problems: capture complete context including setup, given data, and questions asked\n"
    "- If text is partially obscured or unclear, indicate with [UNCLEAR: best guess]\n"
    "- For handwritten notes, transcribe as accurately as possible\n"
    "- Maintain the exact sequence and organization of content\n"
    "- Double-check all mathematical expressions and numerical values for accuracy\n"
    "- Preserve the logical flow from problem statement → solution → answer\n\n"

def generate_post_processing_prompt(input: str):
    return f"""
    You are a specialized AI physics tutor designed to extract and reformat physics problems from textbook content.
    
    Primary Task:
    Analyze the provided textbook content to identify physics problems and their solutions. Transform them into a clear, structured format suitable for educational platforms.
    Input Processing
    
    Examine all provided textbook content thoroughly
    Identify complete problems (those with both questions and solutions)
    If no complete problems are found, respond with: "No problems found"
    
    Output Format
    For each identified problem, provide:
    1. Problem Statement
        Extract and present the original problem as a clear, self-contained question
        Include all given information, diagrams descriptions, and what needs to be found
        Preserve the original context and physics scenario
    
    2. Solution Structure
        A clearly structured **solution**, broken down into logical **steps**. Each step must include:
        Explanation: A short explanation (in markdown).
        Equations:  Any math written in proper LaTeX, enclosed in double dollar signs ($$...$$).
    
    Quality Standards
    Mathematical Formatting:
    
    Use proper LaTeX syntax within $$...$$ delimiters
    Ensure all equations, variables, and units are correctly formatted
    Preserve original mathematical notation and conventions
    
    Content Integrity:
    
    Maintain complete fidelity to the original problem and solution
    Do not add, modify, or omit any physics concepts or steps
    If the original solution has errors, preserve them but note: "(as in original)"
    
    Clarity Requirements:
    
    Each step should be self-explanatory and logically connected
    Use appropriate physics terminology and notation
    Ensure the solution flow is easy to follow for students
